\begin{abstract}

Design and implementation of a distributed tuple space using a multiple client-server architecture.

We implemented a simple version of the State Machine Replication and of the Xu and Liskov version, with the servers communicating with each other within a view, and periodically sending I'm alive statements to check if the neighbours are alive. We will discuss in this report the two variants implemented and how they work.

\Section{Introduction}

This report was made in scope of the project from the course "Development of Distributed Applications". The goal of the project was to design and implement a Distributed Tuple Space using a multiple Client-Server architecture. 
The system had to be able to be tested with two variants of the tuple space, one using the State Machine Replication approach and the other by following the implementation proposed by Xu and Liskov. The system developed should also be fault-tolerant. In this report we will discuss the two variants and their advantages, how they work and justify the design decisions.


%Our main goal was to use two variants of the tuple space, the state Machine Replication and the implementation proposed by Xu and Liskov and create a fault-tolerant System. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    \Section{Implemented Solutions}

The problem to be solved is that servers can fail and the system has to be prepared  to when those failures occur. To solve this problem, we need to implement a fault-tolerant system which is reliable to use.

One of the solutions was to use the State Machine Replication approach, that consists in a general method for implementing a fault-tolerant service by replicating servers and coordinating client interactions with server replicas.

The following steps illustrate what we implemented for State Machine Replication approach:\\
 - Place copies of the Tuple Space on multiple, independent servers.\\
 - Receive client requests, interpreted as Inputs to the State Machine\\
 - Choose an ordering for the Inputs\\
 - Execute Inputs in the chosen order on each server\\
 - Respond to clients with the Output from the Tuple Space\\
 
 
 For the Xu and Liskov version we implemented the following steps:
 
 - a Client stores a set of workers to request the operation;\\
 - each worker store a set of existing replicas;\\
 - the replicas store a set of all existing servers in the node;\\
 - the client send requests to each worker in its set;\\
 - the worker upon receiving each request multicasts it to each replica, sending its id, the message number and the timestamp;\\
 - the replica upon receiving this multicast, verifies if it had already received the message verifying if the message id was lower than the current message id stored for the worker; if it had already received it returns null,if it hasn't it proceeds to doing the computation and returns the corresponding tuple;\\
 - if its a new worker the replica stores the corresponding worker id and the current message number in a hashset;\\
 - In case of the add operation the worker doesn't wait for all replicas to complete;\\
 - if it was a read operation the worker stores all replies from replicas and returns the first reply;\\
 - the take request is divided into two stages, in the first one the replicas receive the multicast stating that is a take operation and the tuple that is to be taken, they identify all matching tuples locking them in the tuple space, and return a set of copies of all matching tuples;\\
 - after receiving all candidate tuples from all replicas, the worker intersects each set of candidate tuple, which can be multiple and then selects a random tuple from that intersection;\\
 - then it multicasts the tuple selected , commanding the replicas to unlock all selected tuples in the first phase and eliminates the corresponding tuple;\\
 - finally it returns the response to the client.\\
 
Replication can increase the service’ performance and capacity since the replicas provide more resources to the service. 
Fault tolerance can be achieved with several replicas through the use of spatial redundancy to the system, making it continue to operate despite the failure of a fraction of these replicas.

Replicated tuple spaces are used to guarantee fault-tolerance and scalibility.

In the SMR approach, the tuple space behaves as a state-machine. The replicas in order to ensure consistecy, must begin with the same data (empty tuple space), execute events in the same order and react deterministically to each event.

In the Xu and Liskov version, the replication strategy is optimized by using partitioning.

We analyzed the time elapsed when executing a given command from the script for the Xu and Liskov version and the SMR version.


First we tested our program with two clients running simultaneuosly and executing the same script.\\
    %Inserir script

For the Xu and Liskov version:\\
    Average Time of client1 for read operation: 806ms\\
    Average Time of client1 for take operation: 730ms\\
    The client2 was blocked because of a take operation that was made first by client1.\\

For the SMR version:\\
    Average Time of client1 for read operation: 590ms\\
    Average Time of client1 for take operation: 706ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for read operation: 516ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for take operation: 226ms\\
    
On the next step, we tested our program with two clients running simultaneuosly and executing different scripts.
    %Inserir scripts
    
For the Xu and Liskov version:
    Average Time of client1 for read operation: 740ms\\
    Average Time of client1 for take operation: 694ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for read operation: 676ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for take operation: 492ms\\
    
    In this version while using two different scripts the average time of execution decreases because the two clients aren't requesting operations for the same tuples.
    
    
    no xu liskov com dois scripts diferentes diminui o tempo medio de execuçao pois ja nao estao ambos atras dos mesmos tuplos

For the SMR version:\\
    Average Time of client1 for read operation: 455ms\\
    Average Time of client1 for take operation: 601ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for read operation: 457ms\\
    Average Time of client2 for take operation: 567ms\\

%Please read the following carefully.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Printing your paper}

Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, $8.5 \times 11$-inch 
white printer paper. A4 paper is also acceptable, but please leave the 
extra 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) at the BOTTOM of the page.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be 
kept within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches 
(22.54 cm) high. Do not write or print anything outside the print area. 
Number your pages lightly, in pencil, on the upper right-hand corners of 
the BACKS of the pages (for example, 1/10, 2/10, or 1 of 10, 2 of 10, and 
so forth). Please do not write on the fronts of the pages, nor on the 
lower halves of the backs of the pages.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of 
the text area is 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm) 
high. Columns are to be 3-1/4 inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a 5/16 inch 
(0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the first page) should 
begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page. The second and 
following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge. On 
all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86 cm) from the 
bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4 paper, 
approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the page.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is 
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in 
appearance to Times that you have access to.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of 
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type. 
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and 
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or 
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank 
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title 
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to 
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format. 

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use 
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, 
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank 
lines between paragraphs. Figure and table captions should be 10-point 
Helvetica boldface type as in
\begin{figure}[h]
   \caption{Example of caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Long captions should be set as in 
\begin{figure}[h] 
   \caption{Example of long caption requiring more than one line. It is 
     not typed centered but aligned on both sides and indented with an 
     additional margin on both sides of 1~pica.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type. 
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, 
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) 
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, 
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\elvbf 1.1. Database elements}) 
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, 
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order 
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially 
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period 
and your text on the same line.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes sparingly%
\footnote
   {%
     Or, better still, try to avoid footnotes altogether.  To help your 
     readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and include necessary 
     peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you 
     prefer, as in this sentence).
   }
and place them at the bottom of the column on the page on which they are 
referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, 
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text, 
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{ex1}. 
Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered. Your artwork must be in place in the 
article (preferably printed as part of the text rather than pasted up). 
If you are using photographs and are able to have halftones made at a 
print shop, use a 100- or 110-line screen. If you must use plain photos, 
they must be pasted onto your manuscript. Use rubber cement to affix the 
images in place. Black and white, clear, glossy-finish photos are 
preferable to color. Supply the best quality photographs and 
illustrations possible. Penciled lines and very fine lines do not 
reproduce well. Remember, the quality of the book cannot be better than 
the originals provided. Do NOT use tape on your pages!

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Color}

The use of color on interior pages (that is, pages other
than the cover) is prohibitively expensive. We publish interior pages in 
color only when it is specifically requested and budgeted for by the 
conference organizers. DO NOT SUBMIT COLOR IMAGES IN YOUR 
PAPERS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Symbols}

If your word processor or typewriter cannot produce Greek letters, 
mathematical symbols, or other graphical elements, please use 
pressure-sensitive (self-adhesive) rub-on symbols or letters (available 
in most stationery stores, art stores, or graphics shops).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Copyright forms}

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit 
your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be 
published in the proceedings.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Conclusions}
